## By Yuchen Lin, Yuanjing Wei, Lin Yang
Virus Fighter is a Bullet Hell game under the game genre Shoot’em up(aka STG). In this type of
game, the player has to combat large amounts of enemies by shooting at them while dodging their
fire. We chose to implement this kind of game because it is fun and easy to play. Besides, we
believe that it would be an excellent opportunity for us to make fair use of OOP since there are at
least four different types of objects (i. e., player, enemy, bullet, boss) in the game.<br/>

The idea of our game mainly comes from the unusual and challenging year. We name our game
Virus Fighter to memorize the tough but admirable and memorable process of people from different
nations and backgrounds working together to fight against covid-19. Besides, we thought the virus
element might add to the uniqueness of the game.<br/>

Virus Fighter is equipped with essential features of the Bullet Hell game. The player could move
up/down/left/right by pressing ”WSAD” and shot by pressing space. There are seven types of
objects: player, enemy, boss, weapon, virus, boss virus, and props. To win the game, the player
has to dodge the viruses shot from enemies while killing enemies by shooting at them to score. An
enemy might leave a prop after it dies, the player could pick it up and gain some advantages. When
the score reaches certain bars, the level goes up, and game status changes. The ultimate boss will
come up at the last level. The final goal for the player is to kill the boss and score as much as
he/she can. If the player is killed by the boss, he/she loses. However, even if the player has killed
the boss, the game will not end until the time is up, or health decreases to zero. During the time
between the boss died and the game ends, the player is encouraged to score as much as he/she can
since the score will be counted for ranking.
